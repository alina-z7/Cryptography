    "We need to talk about **encoding(\\*) and decoding.** (See Hoffstein, Section 1.7.2.) \n",

    " - Let us use Unicode UTF-8 encoding. ([See here](https://www.utf8-chartable.de/unicode-utf8-table.pl?number=128&names=2&utf8=string-literal) for a dictionary of printable and nonprintable characters.)\n",

By the same token, let us write $x_i$ for the UTF-8 literals that are non-printable characters. (Again, see [the dictionary](https://www.utf8-chartable.de/unicode-utf8-table.pl?number=128&names=2&utf8=string-literal).)\n",

(_Warning:_ below I'm using an incorrect/completely-made-up encoding, just for illustrative purposes.)

    "(\\*) The \"proper\" way to encode text is to assign characters to numbers in a such way that they are \"far apart\" when written in binary notation. E.g., the letter `A` might be encoded as `011000` while `B` might be encoded as `000101`. This allows for error detection during transmission. (_E.g._, suppose Bob sends `A`, but static in the transmission line causes the third digit to blip from `1` to `0`, so Alice receives `010000`. \"Hmm. that string is not in my lookup table,\"\" says Alice's computer. The computer tries to repair it... the received message is **three errors away** from `B` but only **one error away** from `A`. Assumig a not-very-noisy channel, Bob must have sent `A`.) But we won't worry about that for now."
